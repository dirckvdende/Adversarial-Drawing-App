            <p>
                Hello! We are a group of three students from Leiden University
                doing research into co-creativity, which is about creativity
                that involves highly interactive cooperation between humans and
                computers. For this, we have made an app that attempts to help
                you be more creative while drawing doodles. The app uses AI
                image recognition to detect how similar your drawing is to the
                objective word, and erases your last stroke if it is too
                similar. We hope this encourages you to be more creative with
                the doodles you draw.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ask you to try out the app, and answer a few questions about
                it afterward. It only takes a couple of minutes, and we promise
                you'll enjoy it!
